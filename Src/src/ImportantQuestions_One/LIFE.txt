You are alone ,
 no matter how many friends YOU MAKE  , how many stops you take whichever directions you may go ,
whichever seeds you may sow ; your path has to be walked by
you.
You are alone .
 Your friends are semblence of noises thal fill your
head ,
 with no activities left you reach love to hide from that dred,
but the dread wont go ,
and it will, keep coming back until you finish your journey yearning for your steps
your friends will most definately go move on and dispassionately remember whal you used to be a long time ago ; your love will increasingly invest in the
diversification of her interests , your role in her history and will be long forgotten and summarised in  instances of jest . For you do not realize the series of now you have abandoned , some for sleep and some for entertainernent ,
and you couldn't even see until the brought  you
down to your knees .
 YOU are alone .
So rise and retrospect to find your way . there is a tomorrow every single day ,
indulge in hearing
the sounds of your pain , ;
lashing out in anger they ask for chanqe.
IT's time to forego the remains of the maimed , whats lost is lost will stay lost in the reserves of the unpaised .
IT's not the man in you but
the titan you need to now embrace .
 So 'RISE MY BROTHER AND
TAKE BACK EVERYTHING YOU HAVE LOST ;
 NOTHING LESS AND
EVERYTHlNG MORE .
BUT STOP FALLINGFOR TEMPORARY
HAPPINESS , FRIENDSHIP UTOPIAS , THE INSIGNIFICANT  THRlLLS OF
FALLING IN LOVE EVERYTIME A PERSON TEXTS YOU BACK .
 YOU ARE ALONE .
 YOU EITHER FINISH YOUR JOURNEY OR YOU STAY LOST YOUR ENTIRE LIFE .
RISE ||
